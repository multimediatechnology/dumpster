> Networking for social food lovers.

## Synopsis

This is our entry for the [EYA 2017 hackathon](https://eu-youthaward.org/social-hackathon-2017/).
We love food and friends and therefore we need to create the ultimate tool to
combine the best of both worlds. **dumpster chef** is an adventurous journey and
your chance to make new friends and the world a better place by opposing the
[*Throw-away society*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw-away_society).

> A **dumpster diver** is someone who takes items that have been discarded, in
order to make better use of them, principally by turning them into something
usable or edible via dumpster diving. <sup>1</sup>

## Concept

**dumpster chef** is a smart tool to help you find a dumpster dive place close
to your location and needs. Just ask for *Spaghetti* and the **dumpster bot** will
answer. Always available, as a smartphone app, you are always a click away from
nice food and great people.

**dumpster chef** also uses a great portion of magic to match you with people that
have similar interests and dinner style (the **dumpster [recommender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)**).
After diving together, you can use recipes and preparation tips for the perfect
dinner w/ your new friends.

The service will also notify you,if a window for diving opens close to your
current location. We also work on a great new [matchmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking)
concept. You only deserve the best.

Share your happiness! :v:
